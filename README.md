# Pyadjoint
## Misfit measurement and adjoint source generation

- Pyadjoint is a small misfit measurement package that calculates misfits on
  two similar time series
- Can be used standlone, but is also wrapped alongside 
  [Pyflex](https://github.com/adjtomo/pyflex) in the misfit quantification 
  package [Pyatoa](https://github.com/adjtomo/pyatoa)
- Documentation for Pyadjoint can be found [on GitHub](https://adjtomo.github.io/pyadjoint)
- Pyadjoint is part of the [adjTomo ecosystem](https://github.com/adjtomo) of tools for 
  adjoint tomography and full waveform inversion
